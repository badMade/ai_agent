          # SECURITY: Using SELF_HEAL_PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN because:
          # - GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger workflows on PRs it creates (GitHub security restriction)
          # - This prevents infinite loops but also prevents required CI checks from running
          # - Self-heal PRs need CI validation before merge, requiring a PAT
          #
          # SELF_HEAL_PAT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
          # - Scope: Minimal permissions - only 'contents:write' and 'pull-requests:write'
          # - Storage: Must be stored as a GitHub repository secret with restricted access
          # - Expiration: Must have an expiration policy (recommended: 90 days max)
          # - Access: Limit to repository admins only
          # - Rotation: Rotate regularly according to organization security policy
